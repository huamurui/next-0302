# Learn Next.js

- [x] i add some function to enable to read markdown file under a folder recursively
  - [ ] but how to deal the image file which is in the same directory with markdown file?—— i don't want to use 'public' folder out side the posts...
- [ ] i want to add a tag system which is being like this——[tag-demo](https://huamurui.github.io/tag-demo/). JSX/TSX is great, but... how to deal with this and using SSR/SSG of Next.js to render the page?... i tried the useState hook but it's not working... and it won't and should not work in SSR/SSG anyway...
  - [ ] i have seen the [cook](https://github.com/YunYouJun/cook/) and [blog](https://github.com/officialrajdeepsingh/markdowbnextjsblog). it seems tha they made it by generating the meta data of files or links and server it to the client... but ...
  - [ ] after this i want to make a real backend to do something... but...

it's so difficult to me .. everything... so dumb...
